6ll6 Garage is a family business Founded by Nkosi Tau, who is a super bike fanatic and always loved to build bikes. The idea he had was fusing the bike with the lion (which is a translation of his surname into English) Why the lion? You may ask. It’s more of the raw the superbike makes when it’s revved and also when speeding through the race track and also the Logo is inspired by the American Car Customisations Company Gas Monkey Garage™ hence the Black and White concept to top it off.

We loved the concept highly and since it’s a family business we had to add a circle to the logo with would clearly symbolize that. Fusing the lion and the bike was really tricky but once we had pulled it off and the client loved it we were over the moon about the response from the client.`,
